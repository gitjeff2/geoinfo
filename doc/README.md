Detailed and open technical documentation of "retro" or "legacy" closed source binaries go here. 

Please do not place third party documentation in this directory unless it meets two conditions:

1. It is properly attributed to its author.
2. The document is expressly released in a free license such as GFLD, BSD, or most Creative Commons licenses. Licenses that forbid commercial use are not permitted.

Please do not add copyrighted texts here without permission.

**NOTE:** The correct directory for third party documents that are widely distributied but of unknown or unreachable authors is the `/doc/legacy` folder.
