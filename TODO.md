# TODO

This project is in a very early state. Existing code will no doubt get rewritten, possibly more than once.

## Goals by Priorty

### High

* Convert the file header code to an object with a solid interface.
* Add code to read the VLIR index.
* Add VLIR Record handling code.
* Ensure a strong separation of concerns between objects.

### Medium

* Write high quality technical documentation for every format this code touches.
* Test everything.

### Low

* Import existing third party technical documentation into /docs in a dedicated subdirectory.
* Pick a license.

## Milestones 

* Introduction of OOP into the codebase.
* Reliable extraction of VLIR records.
* Support for *geowrite 2.1* files, as a simple test case.

## Future

* Support for other CBM GEOS formats beyond text and wordprocessor documents.
* Apple 2gs GEOS CVT support.

## Maybe or Maybe Not

* Non-GEOS C64 file support, especially SpeedScript and friends.
* 1541/71/81 disk image support.
* Apple 2 disk image support.
